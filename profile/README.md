# local-osu-server
An easy-to-use local osu! server that gives you complete control over a customized bancho experience.

## Current Status (Last Updated 7/1/24)
Currently, the only usable and working version of LOS is v1, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jeevanjohnson/local-osu-server).

Right now, LOS is going through a huge rewrite, offering a much cleaner codebase, more features, and an overall better experience for the user.

When LOS is ready to launch, the setup script or however it's decided will be provided here with instructions.

## Thank you
I want to express my gratitude to everyone who has shown support, not only on the repo but also through private messages, letting me know how cool the project is and providing valuable feedback.

Your support has motivated me to consider revamping the whole project to provide you all with a better experience, regardless of whether I play osu anymore or not. ðŸ˜„
